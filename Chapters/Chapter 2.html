<h1>A basic "summary" of the original Matrix movie, continuing straight into the action</h1>

<h2> Chapter Two: The minds inner workings, also I shouldn't have named my git account "Fred Smith", that was stupid </h2>

<p>So after hooking up to the Chinese guys dream from within the dream of the Business guy, DiCaprio ends up on the shore of a place known as Thermopylae. As DiCaprio awakens he's dragged before a group of warriors who claim to be staving off this insane god-king who is feared as a deity. From their description it turns out the asian guy is this god king. Upon seeing that DiCaprio is no threat, the warriors let him go, but not before rejecting his offer to join them. They refused saying he was to much of a pansy to handle their shield techniques. Infuriated and seeing an opportunity to gain the Asian mans trust, DiCaprio goes to the legion that follow the god king and tell them of a route that they can use to flank and destroy the remaining warriors near the shore. As the battle rages on the God King gets arrogant and looks out upon the field himself, only to quickly be impaled by a spear. DiCaprio Looks on in horror realizing that his only hope of escape from this insane land is gone, as this has now become his limbo. He only has these thoughts for a brief moment however, as in the next second his skull is battered by the force of shotgun shells.</p>
<p>It turns out in the time DiCaprio and the Asian where asleep, Arnold Schwarzenegger from the future had come along to crush the resistance starting with Neo and the rest of the dream surfers. Unfortunately Neo's abilities were not fully refined as of this point and he could only escape Arnold by himself, leaving his allies to die. Now Neo's on the run, as robots can easily manipulate their presence in dream spaces, whereas human's require heavy focus to do so. Neo rapidly jumps from Dream level to dream level in a desperate attempt to finish the job before he's forced to fight, but ultimately Arnold is faster than him and soon runs him into a corner.</p>
<p>The place Neo finally gets caught in is an alternate version of New York city that seems to be currently be under siege from aliens. Arnold Catches Neo running down an empty street and promptly puts a cap in both his legs with his last shotgun shell. As Neo crawls along the ground, blood spluttering onto the ground and a nearby car, he turns himself over, face glancing upwards... then smirks as the Jolly green Giant falls from the sky and crushes Arnold where he stands.</p>
<p>To be continued...</p>
