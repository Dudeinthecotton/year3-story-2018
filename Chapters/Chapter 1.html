<h1>An abridged version of the original Matrix movie</h1>

<h2> Chapter One: A much shorter title than the one I had previously to make things more bearable for the reader. Hopefully it stays within the neccesary wordcount. </h2>

<p>OK, So it turns out that Neo (the main character) as well as every other human on the planet save for a small resistance are in a robot created dream reality called "the matrix". Now the fact of the matter is that only certain people can go deeper into this dream reality and attain incredible powers. The issue with this though is that gaining such powers risks the dreamer entering into a state of "limbo" which is essentially a dream coma.</p>
<p>Now Neo has to go into the mind of this businessman and give him the idea that funding the power company for all these evil robots might be a bad idea, it also turns out that this business guy is also a nutjob so this whole shebang is gonna act as therapy for him as well. Sweet.</p>
<p>But the job goes bad as Neo's financial backer that accompanies him into the businessman's mind falls into limbo, and now DiCaprio has to follow him into limbo as its the only possible means of saving him from the crazy dream space.</p>
<p>To be continued...</p>
