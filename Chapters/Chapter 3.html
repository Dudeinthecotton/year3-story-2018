<h1>A basic "summary" of the original Matrix movie, continued to it's conclusion</h1>

<h2> Chapter Three: The minds inner workings, also I shouldn't have named my git account "Fred Smith", that was stupid </h2>

<p>The Green guy barely seems to even notice the miracle he just pulled off before he leaps into the sky, colliding with a giant mechanical Wyrm coated in alien life forms. Neo simply sits there, slowly re-realizing the incredible pain still in his legs. However, this is the first time since entering the dream state that Neo finally has time to think by himself.</p>

<p>As he waits there, he begins to realize that despite the apocalypse occurring around him nothing is coming close enough to harm him. He also begins to ponder on how convenient his rescue was. It soon dawns on him that these are not coincidences, but outcomes from his presence. As "the one" His desires are fluctuating the world around him, giving him the power to essentially reign as a god within this domain. With this power, came a terrible desire.</p>

<p>He alone could become the harbringer of a new age. An age that, while yes run by machines, would give every sentient being in the world the powers that he wields right now. All it would take would be a re-establishing of the current order. A slight change in the Matrixes program would be all he needed. And Neo just so happen to have a pile of scrap nearby with access to the Matrixes system that could jump through all of a persons dream levels and potentially alter them just as he can. He repaired the Arnold with barely a thought, and soon had it re-programmed to go within every humans mind, spreading its programing to other devices of its like and altering the awareness of all humans it came into contact with so that they may be aware of the total extent of their power. But first it went about eliminating any remaining members of the the dream surfers, that they may never destroy the illusion of this new utopia. After all, ignorance is bliss.</p>
