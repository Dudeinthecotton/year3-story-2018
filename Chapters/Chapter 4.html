<h1>A basic "summary" of the original Matrix movie, continued to it's conclusion</h1>

<h2> Chapter Three(?): The minds inner workings, also I shouldn't have named my git account "Fred Smith", that was stupid </h2>

<p>The Green guy barely seems to even notice the miracle he just pulled off before he leaps into the sky, colliding with a giant mechanical Wyrm coated in alien life forms. Neo simply sits there, slowly re-realizing the incredible pain still in his legs. However, this is the first time since entering the dream state that Neo finally has time to think by himself.</p>

<p>As he waits there, he begins to realize that despite the apocalypse occurring around him nothing is coming close enough to harm him. He also begins to ponder on how convenient his rescue was. It soon dawns on him that these are not coincidences, but outcomes from his presence. As "the one" His desires are fluctuating the world around him, giving him the power to essentially reign as a god within this domain. With this power, came a terrible desire.</p>

<p>But then the Hulk flies down from the air above and flattens our would be deadly mesiah into a bloody pulp.</p>

<p>It is a truly terrible and horrific sight, quite frankly not suited to intimate description. Nor is it suited for this story in general, that is why we have the cutting room floor. Sometimes things just need to be edited out for the greater good of the end product, even if that is a painful truth to admit sometimes. Artists are prone to get attached to their work after all, it can be hard to narrow ones focus in order to achieve above average results in a single area, instead of mediocrely aiming for broad appeal. But generally it's a price worth paying.
