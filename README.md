# CiaranOMearaGitStory

This is a Story made using Git, used to display one's ability to use the service for project management.

In terms of my specific project, my story will be a parody style story based around the matrix and other films.

As the story progresses the characters become increasingly strange and their motives bizarre. It's really rather nonsensical.

Now with an extra spooky, super secret ending, wooooooooooo.
